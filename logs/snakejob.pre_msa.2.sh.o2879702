Analysis Description
--------------------
 Load nucleotide sequences (SOME of which **must be in frame**), perform
frameshift correction as needed, and translate to amino-acids for
subsequent alignment.

code: Universal
[Data QC] Loaded 179 sequences on 1401 sites from **/home/aglucaci/AOC-REM2/results/mammalian_REM2/mammalian_REM2**
Load reference sequences from : reference: data/mammalian_REM2/Rem2_Human.fasta
Maximum acceptable fraction of N's (permissible range = [0,1], default value = 0.05): N-fraction: 1.0
Trim non-reference sequences from this position (permissible range = [0,10000000], default value = 0, integer): trim-from: 0
Trim non-reference sequences to this position (permissible range = [-1,10000000], default value = -1, integer): trim-to: -1
keep-reference: No
[Data QC] Will write unaligned protein sequences for MSA to **/home/aglucaci/AOC-REM2/results/mammalian_REM2/mammalian_REM2_protein.fas**, and the corresponding nucleotide sequences to **/home/aglucaci/AOC-REM2/results/mammalian_REM2/mammalian_REM2_nuc.fas**
[Data QC] Found 0 unique sequences that were in frame
[Advanced Setting -- Sequence similarity is based on an alignment score and is not normalized between 0 and 1. ] Expected sequence similarity (0 to automatically compute).  (permissible range = [0,1], default value = 0): E: 0
skip-realignment: No
remove-stop-codons: No
[Data QC] Correcting frame-shifts in the remaining reads
[Data QC] Checking for frame-preserving indels in other reads
[Next steps] Please run **/home/aglucaci/AOC-REM2/results/mammalian_REM2/mammalian_REM2_protein.fas** through an MSA program, and then run post-msa.bf on the output and **/home/aglucaci/AOC-REM2/results/mammalian_REM2/mammalian_REM2_nuc.fas** to recover the nucleotide MSA
