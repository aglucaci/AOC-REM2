MissingOutputException in rule iqtree_bootstrapped in file /home/aglucaci/AOC-REM2/Snakefile, line 222:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 60 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:

Shutting down, this might take some time.
